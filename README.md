# rock_paper_scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where players make figures in the direction of their opponent with one of their hands, to either represent a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors.

How the game is played physically:
A rock is represented by folding one's hand into a fist
Paper is represented by opening the palm like the way you would extend it if you wanted to give someone a handshake
Scissors is represented by extending the index and middle fingers like a "V" while the others remain in a fist
The game is normally started by opening one palm and placing the second one, which is in a fist, on top, then you say Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot, and begin making figures of your choice with your hand.

The winner is determined as stated below:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
It's a tie if the figure made by you and your opponent is the same and you have to replay the round

I recreated this in codes ðŸ¤—, your opponent is the computer, let's see who is a better player ðŸ˜‰
